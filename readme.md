Now you need to run the following command in your termninal.

    java -jar <location of SquadTest.jar file> <location of input file> 
    
For example if my SquadTest.jar file is saved at /home/vatsal/ and my input file is saved at /home/vatsal/ with the name input.txt then I need to enter the following command

    java -jar /home/vatsal/SquadTest.jar /home/vatsal/input.txt
    
Doing this will print the output of the instructions in your terminal.
